# MVC Architecture

## MVC Architecture Concept
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
(https://javawebtutor.com/articles/spring/spring-mvc-tutorial.php#)


MVC (Model - View - Controller) is software design pattern commonly used for developing user interface that divides the relates program logic into three interconnected elements.

Spring MVC is used to develop the application that uses MVC design pattern. By using Spring MVC we can build flexible and losse coulped web application.

Model
    The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, indepent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic, and rule of the application.
View
    Any representation of information such as chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of same information are possible.
Controller
    Controller are responsible for receiving the request from user and calling the back-end service.

### Spring MVC

Front Controller
    Front controller known as DispatcherServlet: Part of the Spring Framwork, Already developed by Spring DEV Team
Controller
    Contains your business logic:
        Handle the request.
        Store / Retrieve data (db, web service).
        Place data in model
    Send to appropriate view template
Model
    It is the application's dynamic data structure.
    Store / Retrieve data via backend systems
        database, web service,...
    You can take that data and place it into the model
View Template
    Spring MVC is flexible: supports many view template.
    JSP (Java Server Pages)
    JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library)
 

## Advantage of Spring MVC Framework

Clear separation of responsibilities because it implements MVC design pattern

Loose coupling among Model, View, Controller

In built front controller.

Simplified validation implementation

Simplified exception handling.

## Spring MVC Flow

1. Client(Browser) requests for a Resource in the web Application.

2. The Spring front controller i.e, DispatcherServlet first receives the request.

3. DispatcherServlet consults the HandlerMapping to identify the particular controller for the given URL.

4. HandlerMapping identifies the controller for the given request and sends to the DispatcherServlet.

5. DispatcherServlet will call the handleRequest(request,response) method on Controller. A Controller is developed by writing a simple java class which implements Controller interface or extends its adapter class.

6. Controller will call the business method according to business requirement.

7. Service class will call the DAO class method for business data.

8. DAO interacts with DB to get data.

9. DAO returns same data to service.

10. Fetched data will be processed according to business requirement and return results to Controller.

11. The Controller returns the Model and View in the form of Object back to the Controller i.e, DispatcherServlet.

12. The front controller i.e, DispatcherServlet then tries to resolve the actual View which may be JSP,velocity or Free Marker by consulting the View Resolver Object.

13. ViewResolver selected view is rendred back to the DispatcherServlet.

14. DispatcherServletconsult the particular view with the model.

15. View executes and returns HTML output to the DispatcherServlet.

16. DispatcherServlet will sends the output to the Browser.

## Components of a Spring MVC Application

A set of web pages to layout UI components

A collection of spring beans (controller, services, etc ...)

Spring configuration (XML, Annotation or java)


## What is a Controller in Spring MVC?

Just like MVC design pattern, Controller is the class that takes care of all the client requests and send them to the configured resources to handle it. In Spring MVC, org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet is the front controller class that initializes the context based on the spring beans configurations.

A Controller class is responsible to handle a different kind of client requests based on the request mappings. We can create a controller class by using @Controller annotation. Usually, itâ€™s used with @RequestMapping annotation to define handler methods for specific URI mapping.
