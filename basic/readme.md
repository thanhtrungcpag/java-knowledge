Difference between abstract and interface in java.

Concept:
Class Abstract only is a construction or instruction created for specified class
Interface is a form, it does not automatically do anything. but there is a class contract with it, the class must obey this rule of Interface Class.

Differece:
1. Method: Interface can have only abstract method. Abstract can have abstract and non-abstract.
2. Variables: Class abstract have final, non-final, static and non-static variable. Interface only have static and final variables.
3. Implementation: Abstract class can provide implementation of interface. Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
4. Inheritance: interface can extend another java interface only, an abstract class can extend another java class and implement multiple java interfaces.
5. Accessiblity: members of a java interface are public by default. a java abstract class have class members like private, protected, etc.
